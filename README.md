# Sql-challenge

## Challenge Overview:
- Using PostgreSQL to inspect csv files
- Using QuickDBD to sketch an Entity Relatioship Diagram
- Creating a schema using SQL through PgAdmin 4
- Identify appropriate data types, primary keys and foreign keys for data in the csv files

## Data:
- Employees csv file contains data of employees' number, first name, last name, birth date, employee title id, sex, and hire date
- Title csv file contains employee title id, and a column with what the titles are
- Department csv file contains dapartment number and department name
- Dept_emp csv file contains the employees' number and department number
- Dept_manager csv file contains the departments number and employees' number
- Salaries csv file contains employees' number and salary 

## Analysis:
Using SQL we were asked to inspect the data by doing the following:
1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
